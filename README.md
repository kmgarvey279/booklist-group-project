# My Virtual Bookshelf

#### by Ian Christopher, Kevin Garvey, Svitlana Filanova, Marguerite Kennedy annd Tessa Sullivan.

#### A simple app to create a virtual bookcase, featuring books the user is reading or plans to read, as well as a stack of finished books for others to take a look at. Created as a group project for Epicodus (JavaScript module), demonstrating knowledge of JavaScript, Angular, API calls and more.

## Specs

|Behavior - Plain English|Input|Output|
|---|---|---|

User lands on homepage.|n User logs in to search books by *author, title and/or subject* | The app returns a list of relevant books based on search |
|User wants to create a "bookshelf" to sort reading list by books they *have read, are reading, and have read*| Links to books appear by category in a virtual "bookshelf."|

Minimum viable product: User will be able to search books based on  based on data provided by the Google Books API. They will then be able to add these books to their "bookshelf," sorted by "read" or "unread."

Future buildout could include links to other user bookshelves, or searching for book recommendations based on users who have at least one of the same books on their bookshelves, although that functionality is not in the immediate scope of this project. Other possible features could eventually include a "virtual librarian" that would recommend books based on interests, mood, etc.

## Technologies Used

_This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0._

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
